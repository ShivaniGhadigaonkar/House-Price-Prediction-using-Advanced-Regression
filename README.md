# House-Price-Prediction-using-Advanced-Regression
This is the solution for Kaggle's house price prediction project for which I have used regression analysis to predict the house prices.
This project is divided into two parts 1) Feature Engineering and 2) Model Training
For categorical data I have used pd.get_dummies to convert the categorical features into numeric features.
For Model training I have used XGBRegressor.
